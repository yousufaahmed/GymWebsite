            <h3>Healthy Food:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">Healthy food is very important, because it keeps your insides healthy, just like exercise keeps your outside healthy. Without a good diet of healthy food, filled with nutrients and veggies, you could be as fat as a water balloon, or as thin as a twig. Too thin, or too fat are both very bad, as they could give you very serious and dangerous health problems. A balanced diet is crucial for exercise as well, because without it, you won\'t be able to exercise properly, and all of your valiant efforts will have all gone to waste.</p>

            <h3>Food Pyramid:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">The food pyramid teaches you about the hierarchy of foods, and how much of each you should consume. Too much of any of them is unhealthy. Eating unhealthily doesn't necessarily mean you are eating junk foods. Eating too much of a specific healthy food can also be bad for you. As you can see on the pyramid, carbs are at the bottom, because they give you lots of energy and are not very filling. They are not too healthy to eat, though. There are then fruits and veggies, which are very healthy to eat and should be your main thing to eat, as they provide lots of vitamins and minerals that you need to be healthy. You then have the dairy and meat group. This group is high in protein and thus should be eaten in a protein diet, although still very healthy to eat. Lastly, you have fats and sugars. These should be eaten sparingly, because they could be very bad for you if you eat too much of it. They can give you cavities, or make you fat. This category contains all junk food, fizzy drinks, sweets, oil and other items.</p>

            <h3>Food to avoid:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">Avoiding food, doesn't mean not consuming it. You might like going to McDonalds down the street, or munching down on that KFC. Everyone loves some junk food every now and then. But this kind of food is very unhealthy, because the ingredients of the food are unknown, and it just drips with oil which could have been sitting in someones back yard for a year. I recommend that you make and eat your own fast foods at home, because you will know what you put in the food, and you can cook it to be much healthier than fast food restaurants. Other food to avoid can include soft drinks, sugary candy, or milk chocolate. Dark chocolate might have a bit of sugar in it, but it is much healthier and has health benefits to it as well.</p>

            <h3>Protein or no Protein:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">Protein will be a necessity if you are going to be doing muscle training. Being put on a protein diet will make muscle making easy. Protein is not that necessary for exercise though, and it is much healthier to eat a balanced, healthy diet. But too little protein could give you a health condition called Kwashiorkor, which inflates your belly and could be fatal. What about protein shakes and bars? They provide short-term protein, which may give you the protein you need for a short time, but will run out, and you could lose all the muscle that you gained within your workout time. We recommend that you don't drink or eat protein shakes/bars because they aren't as good as getting natural protein from meat and milk, etc. even though they might taste good.</p>
