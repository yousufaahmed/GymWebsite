      <h3>Exercise:</h3>
      <p class="aboutText"><img class="firstImage" src="images/H&L main photo.jpg" alt="H&L-img">Exercise is very important in our lives, because it keeps our brain, mind, and body healthy. It gives your body strength and stamina, which helps reduce damage to your body in ways such as strain and cramps, but it also makes your body used to things like running, which means that all of your muscles will work better when you get older. If you go and have a look at an old age home, almost all the old people over there can barely move. This is mainly because of their lack of exercise when growing up or when they were adults. If you want to protect yourself from becoming defenceless when you grow up, then exercise is the way to go. Exercise also makes it so that you are less likely to get ill, because when you are training yourself out in the gym, you are also training your immune system to fight all the bacteria and viruses that enter your body.<br><br>Healthiness isn't all about exercise, though. You have to eat healthily too. Head on down to the diet page to check out the best meals for your exercising preference. If you want to know more about exercises to do, then check out the Teen and Adult pages, for exercises which will make you a healthier, stronger person. If you have any questions, you can have a look at the common questions section below this text, or you can head down to the footer of this page and click on the links which will take you to our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and email.</p>
