            <h3>Exercises:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">There are many exercises that teens like you can do. In fact, you can do more exercises than adults! As teens, you are still young and thus have a more flexible body. You can use this to your advantage and do most exercises easily. So what exercises? There are many types of exercises that you can do, from stretching, to weight lifting, to other different kinds of sports. You can do some of the easiest and most portable kinds of exercises anywhere. You can do push-ups. These test your strength on your arms. So many people try to do these and fail miserably. This is partly due to the fact that they are weak, but it is also due to the fact that they don't know how to do them. You can do planks. These test the strength of your arms and your belly. These aren't difficult at all, and they are an easy and quick way to make some ab muscles. You can do sit ups. These are also not difficult at all, and target the belly. There will be some videos to guide you through how to do these exercises at the bottom of this text.</p>

            <h3>Inspiration:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">You see people exercising. Looks easy enough. You try it for yourself. It's difficult. What do you do? Give up? No. You try and try again and again, until you succeed. Why? Because laziness isn't going to get you anywhere. The more you push yourself, the better results you are going to get. You know what they say, practice makes perfect. This is definitely true, not only for exercise, but for everything in life, from your studies, to playing your games, to even acing one of those crane picker things in a theme park. Practice applies to everything. What if I'm too weak to do those weight exercises? You are not weak. You just haven't developed the muscles for it yet. Everything takes time in life, and that time is never going to come back. So make the most of your time and use it wisely. Don't waste it on something that you will regret 10 years into the future.</p>

            <h3>Mental Health:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">Mental health is more important than physical health. If you can't get your mind straight, you won't be able to do anything. I get it, you're stressed, and you're feeling down. You might have recently lost a loved one, or you could have lost a match of football. Tough luck. You have to move on. You can't bring back what is already gone. You can't go back in time. Beating yourself about something that wasn't your fault isn't going to do anything. You are only damaging your self-morale and mind by doing this. If you are really feeling down, you could always call someone. So many people go through the same as you, and perhaps even worse than you. But some of them decide that this is enough. I'm not going to go through any more of this pain, and I'm going to move on. They then go on to live happier than ever before. You could be one of those people. Stand up for yourself, and admit that feeling down or being sad is going to get you nowhere. You know a way to boost your mental health? Exercise. It releases hormones that make you happy. So why not come on down to our centre, and have a bit of fun!</p>

            <h3>E-sports and Gamer Health:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">So many people around the world sit there in front of a screen and try to win whatever kind of game they are playing. The key word there is 'sit'. Most gamers without any sort of restrictions just sit there for the entire day, without any movement at all, drinking energy drinks to keep them up overnight during long gaming sessions. This is very bad for health. If you are going to game, you have to do it healthily. Many e-sports teams have restrictions in place to make their players as healthy as can be, while getting the most game time out of them. You should try implementing some restrictions for yourself. Restrictions could include gaming from this to this time, then taking a break for lunch, or playing this many matches before you wrap up your gaming session. You should always try turning of your game at least an hour before you sleep, so that your eyes have a more restful night.</p>
