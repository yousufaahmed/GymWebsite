Avoiding food, doesn't mean not consuming it. You might like going to McDonalds down the street, or munching down on that KFC. Everyone loves some junk food every now and then. But this kind of food is very unhealthy, because the ingredients of the food are unknown, and it just drips with oil which could have been sitting in someones back yard for a year. I recommend that you make and eat your own fast foods at home, because you will know what you put in the food, and you can cook it to be much healthier than fast food restaurants. Other food to avoid can include soft drinks, sugary candy, or milk chocolate. Dark chocolate might have a bit of sugar in it, but it is much healthier and has health benefits to it as well.
Protein will be a necessity if you are going to be doing muscle training. Being put on a protein diet will make muscle making easy. Protein is not that necessary for exercise though, and it is much healthier to eat a balanced, healthy diet. But too little protein could give you a health condition called Kwashiorkor, which inflates your belly and could be fatal. What about protein shakes and bars? They provide short-term protein, which may give you the protein you need for a short time, but will run out, and you could lose all the muscle that you gained within your workout time. We recommend that you don't drink or eat protein shakes/bars because they aren't as good as getting natural protein from meat and milk, etc. even though they might taste good.

You see people exercising. Looks easy enough. You try it for yourself. It's difficult. What do you do? Give up? No. You try and try again and again, until you succeed. Why? Because laziness isn't going to get you anywhere. The more you push yourself, the better results you are going to get. You know what they say, practice makes perfect. This is definitely true, not only for exercise, but for everything in life, from your studies, to playing your games, to even acing one of those crane picker things in a theme park. Practice applies to everything. What if I'm too weak to do those weight exercises? You are not weak. You just haven't developed the muscles for it yet. Everything takes time in life, and that time is never going to come back. So make the most of your time and use it wisely. Don't waste it on something that you will regret 10 years into the future.
Mental health is more important than physical health. If you can't get your mind straight, you won't be able to do anything. I get it, you're stressed, and you're feeling down. You might have recently lost a loved one, or you could have lost a match of football. Tough luck. You have to move on. You can't bring back what is already gone. You can't go back in time. Beating yourself about something that wasn't your fault isn't going to do anything. You are only damaging your self-morale and mind by doing this. If you are really feeling down, you could always call someone. So many people go through the same as you, and perhaps even worse than you. But some of them decide that this is enough. I'm not going to go through any more of this pain, and I'm going to move on. They then go on to live happier than ever before. You could be one of those people. Stand up for yourself, and admit that feeling down or being sad is going to get you nowhere. You know a way to boost your mental health? Exercise. It releases hormones that make you happy. So why not come on down to our centre, and have a bit of fun!
So many people around the world sit there in front of a screen and try to win whatever kind of game they are playing. The key word there is 'sit'. Most gamers without any sort of restrictions just sit there for the entire day, without any movement at all, drinking energy drinks to keep them up overnight during long gaming sessions. This is very bad for health. If you are going to game, you have to do it healthily. Many e-sports teams have restrictions in place to make their players as healthy as can be, while getting the most game time out of them. You should try implementing some restrictions for yourself. Restrictions could include gaming from this to this time, then taking a break for lunch, or playing this many matches before you wrap up your gaming session. You should always try turning of your game at least an hour before you sleep, so that your eyes have a more restful night.
You are an adult. Adults like you come in a variety of shapes and forms. You could be young and would be able to do any exercise thrown at you, while the slightly older could find the exercises quite difficult and would take longer to do them. Anyhow, the exercises are pretty similar for most of you, but for some people, such as old people, doing vigourous exercises could be very dangerous and could kill them. Our recommendation is that you speak to the people at the reception, and they will help you out with specialty exercises. So what exercises? There are many different types of exercises that you can do, from stretching, to weight lifting, to other different kinds of sports. You can do some of the easiest and most portable kinds of exercises anywhere. You can do pushups. These test your strength on your arms. So many people try to do these and fail miserably. This is partly due to the fact that they are weak, but it is also due to the fact that they don't know how to do them. You can do planks. These test the strength of your arms and your belly. These aren't difficult at all, and they are an easy and quick way to make some ab muscles. You can do situps. These are also not difficult at all, and target the belly.

Once you are an Adult, you can't grow anymore, and thus maintaining your health is very important. Once you start exercising, you will have to keep exercising at least once a week in order to retain the level of strength and stretchiness that you had. Maintaining it is quite easy, much easier than getting healthy again. You just have to do a few exercises per week, less than what you initially started with when first exercising. Doing this on a regular basis will keep you healthy, and you will be able to do whatever exercises and activities you want to do without a fear of aging. You will also have to have a balanced diet, for every day of the week, if you want any of this to take any sort of effect on you.
You might be thinking, hey nice talk but how can I get to that level of fitness if I can't even do five pushups? Simple answer really. Practice. You have to try and try over and over, until you get enough strength to complete your exercises. There are ways to do specific exercises which can make it easier for you, yet still give you strength so you can do the exercises the proper way, e.g. doing pushups on knees. You have to have a healthy diet, or your exercising will take no effect on you, and you will just give up. It is possible to get good strength and other features without a balanced diet, but it will be much harder, and you wont be as healthy on the inside.
