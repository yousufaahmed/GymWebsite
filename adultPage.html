            <h3>Exercises for you:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">You are an adult. Adults like you come in a variety of shapes and forms. You could be young and would be able to do any exercise thrown at you, while the slightly older could find the exercises quite difficult and would take longer to do them. Anyhow, the exercises are pretty similar for most of you, but for some people, such as old people, doing vigourous exercises could be very dangerous and could kill them. Our recommendation is that you speak to the people at the reception, and they will help you out with specialty exercises. So what exercises? There are many different types of exercises that you can do, from stretching, to weight lifting, to other different kinds of sports. You can do some of the easiest and most portable kinds of exercises anywhere. You can do pushups. These test your strength on your arms. So many people try to do these and fail miserably. This is partly due to the fact that they are weak, but it is also due to the fact that they don't know how to do them. You can do planks. These test the strength of your arms and your belly. These aren't difficult at all, and they are an easy and quick way to make some ab muscles. You can do situps. These are also not difficult at all, and target the belly. There will be some videos to guide you through how to do these exercises at the bottom of this text.</p>

            <h3>How to maintain your health:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">Once you are an Adult, you can't grow anymore, and thus maintaining your health is very important. Once you start exercising, you will have to keep exercising at least once a week in order to retain the level of strength and stretchiness that you had. Maintaining it is quite easy, much easier than getting healthy again. You just have to do a few exercises per week, less than what you initially started with when first exercising. Doing this on a regular basis will keep you healthy, and you will be able to do whatever exercises and activities you want to do without a fear of aging. You will also have to have a balanced diet, for every day of the week, if you want any of this to take any sort of effect on you.</p>

            <h3>How to get healthy again:</h3>
            <p class="aboutText">You might be thinking, hey nice talk but how can I get to that level of fitness if I can't even do five pushups? Simple answer really. Practice. You have to try and try over and over, until you get enough strength to complete your exercises. There are ways to do specific exercises which can make it easier for you, yet still give you strength so you can do the exercises the proper way, e.g. doing pushups on knees. You have to have a healthy diet, or your exercising will take no effect on you, and you will just give up. It is possible to get good strength and other features without a balanced diet, but it will be much harder, and you wont be as healthy on the inside.</p>
